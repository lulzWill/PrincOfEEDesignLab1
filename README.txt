In order to run the software you can just go to this link: http://princofeedesignlab1-tempsensor.rhcloud.com/
Alternatively, the software can be run on a localhost with PHP installed and Apache running by opening index.html in the browser of your choice(preferably Chrome). An Easy way to run a webserver on localhost is to download XAMPP (https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) and use it to run Apache and PHP.

Arduino code is also included here, in order to get it running on the board you must download the Arduino IDE and upload the program to an Arduino Yun board.
